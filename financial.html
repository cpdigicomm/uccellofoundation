        <p class="lead">For more than 45 years, the California Housing Finance Agency (CalHFA) has supported the needs of low- and moderate-income renters and homebuyers by providing financing and programs with a focus on equity. Established in 1975, CalHFA was chartered as the state's affordable housing lender. The Agency's Multifamily Lending Division finances affordable rental housing through collaborations with developers, local, state and federal government partners and more, while its Single Family Division partners with a preferred lender network to provide first-time homebuyers with down payment and closing cost assistance and access to first mortgage loans. CalHFA is a self-supported state agency that doesn't rely on taxpayers dollars for its operational costs but regularly administers various state and federal resources on behalf of the state.</p>
